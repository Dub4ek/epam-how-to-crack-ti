# **Infrastructure / SDLC Interview Questions**

## **Week 1**

### **1. What is SCRUM?**

**SCRUM** is an agile framework which provides a way of deliver value incrementally in an iterative and collaborative manner.

### **2. Scrum Roles**

There are 3 main roles in a Scrum team

- **Scrum Master** is responsible for ensuring the scrum team behaves as effectively as possible with scrum values. Keep the team on track, remove any obsticles team might face, and plan team meetings.
- **Product Owner** makes sure that the scrum team aligns with the product goals. Prodct owners also must understand customer expectations and the market trends and clearly.
- **Development Team** is the team that works hands-on to to complete the tasks in a scrum sprint. Development team, doesn't just wait for the orders, and map out the goals and plans to complete the task on hand.

### **3. Ceremonies**

There are 4 scrum ceremonies during a Scrum sprint

- **Sprint Planning** is held to plan and map out the work that is to be completed during the sprint
- **Daily Stand-up** is the meeting where development team and the scrum master goes over the progress that was done the day before and the tasks that were planned to be completed in the day.
- **Sprint Review** is held to get feedback from the stakeholders by reviewing the current state of the product that was created during the sprint.
- **Sprint Retrospective** is the meeting where scrumt team evaluates and looks for ways of improvement their process and collaboration.

### **4. Artifacts**

**Scrum Artifacts** can be examined under three main concepts.

- **Product Backlog**
  Product Backlog can be considered like a sorted to-do list which contains all the things the product needs and user stories.

- **Sprint Backlog**
  Sprint Backlog is a set **product backlog** which represents the tasks that needs to be completed during a certain sprint that aims to provide more value for the product.

- **Increment**
  Increment represents the sum of completed tasks in the backlogs as well as the total increment of the values generated by all previous sprints.

### **5. Agile Manifest**

**Agile Manifest** provide best practices and guidelines for agile development. It basically suggests that being open to change, communication, collaboration and a working product quality should be the main goals of a software development process.

### **6. Scrum Cycle**

**Scrum Sprint Cycle** is a timeboxed period when a team delivers a set amount of work. Typically takes between two to four weeks.

**Basic Explanation of a Scrum Cycle:**

- **Product backlog** gets reviewed by the scrum team depending on team's past velocity and prioritized tasks get pulled to the **sprint backlog**.
- **Sprint planning** meeting takes place to plan and map out to complete the tasks.
- **Daily Stand-ups** are planned on daily basis for 15 minutes max to review and evaluate the progress in an iterative manner.
- **Sprint Review** is held to get feedback and look for the ways to improve product value.
- **Sprint Retrospective** is planned at the end of the sprint to look for the ways to improve efficiency, communication and collaboration within the team for the next sprint.

### **7. Scrum Estimation**

Within Scrum Teams, **estimation** is done by the entire team during **sprint planning** meetings. The objective is to evaluate the priority and the ability of the team to complete user stories that are planned to delivered during the sprint.

### **8. How do you estimate a task?**

There are some techniques to testimate a task. **One of them is Planning Poker Technique**

In **Planning Poker** the entire team comes together and provide estimates for certain user stories using numbers from the Fibonacci Sequence. During Planning Poker, team members can provide an estimated number (which refers to a certain time period) and provide their way of thinking for their choice, so the other team members can accept or express their opinion. Therefore, an agreed estimation on a certain task can be set.

### **9. Testing Pyramid**

**Test pyramid** is a framework that determines the order and frequency of tests for each layer of a a software. Provides useful insight for a successful development process.

### **10. Unit Tests**

**Unit Tests** are the tests that test the smallest, testable piece of code. They should be as frequent as possible and provide high code coverage.

### **11. Design Patterns**

**Design Patterns** are typical solutions to occuring problems in software design. There are no strict rules about how to implement them. Design patterns are more of a blueprint to solve a specific problem.

### **12. Benefits Of Patterns**

- **Design Patterns** are tried and tested, proven solutions to specific problems. Design patterns can help developers how to solve certain problems using principles of OOP.
  **Design Pattenrs** also provide a common language that each individual in a team could use to communicate more efficiently.

### **13. Creational Patterns**

**Creational Patterns** provides object creations mechanisms that increase flexibility and reusability

Some Creational Patterns are as follow:

- Factory
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

### **14. Behavioral Patterns**

**Bheavioral Patterns** are used to solve problems that might occur while creating the behaviour of a certain piece of code. They're mostly about alogrithms and responsibilities between objects.

Some Behavioral Patterns are as follow:

- Chain Of Responsibility
- Observer
- Strategy
- Memento
- Mediator
- Template

### **15. SOLID Principles**

**SOLID Principles** stands for five OOP design principles. Following these principles would help developers to create easier to extend and maintain projects.

- **(S)ingle Responsibility** states that a class should only have **one** job.
- **(O)pen-Closed** states that all entities should be open for extension but should be closed to modifications.
- **(L)iskov Substitution** states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
- **(I)nterface Segregation** states that clients should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, or depend on methods that are not used.
- **(D)ependency Inversion** states that classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

### **16. CI/CD/CD**

- **Continious Integration(CI)**
  **Continious Integration** is merging all team member's work into a mainline repository in a partially automated manner including QA processes. It should be done frequently (at least once a day or many times a day).

- **Continious Delivery(CD)**
  **Continious Delivery** is an extension of Continious Integration. It's a fully automated process of that takes place until a production ready release is validated and completed. During continous delivery, all process are automated except the decision for the deployment.

- **Continious Deployment(CD)**
  **Continious Deployment** is very much like Continious Delivery, except the deployment decision. In Continious deployment, every successful release will be pushed to deployment and served to the customers in an automated manner unless one of the process steps fail. Shortly, **Continious deployment** is the full automation of the processes that starts with CI until the deployment
