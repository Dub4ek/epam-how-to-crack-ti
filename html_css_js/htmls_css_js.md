### **1. 6 When should you use section, div or article?**

`<section`, `<div>` and `<article>` tags are used for grouping content.The key differences about when they should be used is as follows:

- `<article>` is almost same as `<section>` but the content should make sense by its own. It doesn't have to be related to the rest of the page.
- `<div>` is mostly used for grouping content when other grouping tags' requirements are not met. Such as anchors, buttons, etc.
